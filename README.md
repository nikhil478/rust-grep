In this project, I will be building a CLI tool similar to `grep` using Rust. To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run -- ./doc/poem.txt > output.txt
```

This command runs the Rust program, processing the input file `poem.txt` located in the `./doc` directory, and redirects the output to `output.txt`.
